      "value": "Anesthesia; or, The Chair as Image. Q&A. John Harwood begins his remarks on the chair with a Theodore Roethke poem: A funny thing about a chair, / You hardly ever think it's there. / To know a Chair is really it, / You sometimes have to go and sit. With a bit of good humor, Harwood traces the history of the chair‚Äîfrom the ancient Egyptians who considered it a privilege to sit on chairs to the modern ubiquity of chairs‚Äîas he remarks on the changing and developing relationship between the human body and the chair. His discussion includes a portrait of architects' experimentation with chairs and the ergonomics of the chair. John Harwood is a professor of Art History at Oberlin college, where he specializes in modern and contemporary architectural history. Harwood's research centers on the relationships between science, technology, corporate organization and their architectural articulation. He is co-author, with Janet Parks, of The Troubled Search: The Work of Max Abramovitz (2004). He is currently completing a book - The Redesign of Design: Computer, Architect, Corporation - on the spatial and temporal aspects of computing technology, ergonomics, and corporate architecture. Prof. Harwood's visit to the University of Minnesota was organized by the Design, Architecture, and Culture Group of Quadrant."
